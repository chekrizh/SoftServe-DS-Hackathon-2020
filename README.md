## Competition description  

### Introduction
People turnover numbers were always important for any organization, especially in the case of their continued growth â€“ the more the organization is growing the more these numbers become critical. Therefore, it is more significant now than ever to make sure that the number of voluntary dismissals is very low. As this would lead to huge savings
related to the cost per hire, including advertising, recruiting, training, internship expenses, and variance in salary between hired
and dismissed employees. Obviously, the most cost-efficient and effective approach overall is to manage unwanted dismissals by preventing them in a timely manner before a person makes the final decision to leave the company.

We propose to participate in the competition on best solution in the area of HR Analytics and try to develop the predictive model, which provides the assessment of the Employees Dismissal Risk, based on the historical data analysis.

### Problem Description
The major goal of the competition - develop a model, which provides an answer to the question - "Will the particular Employee leave the Company within the next three months?"

Solution should be made with respect of the following business goals:

  1. Managers should have a notification about Employees even in case of insignificant risk of Dismissal
  2. Managers should get an information regarding Dismissal drivers - the interpretability of the prediction result is desirable
  3. Managers should get the recommendations regarding potential actions for Employees retention.
Point 1 is mandatory for this competition, points 2-3 are optional and will be assessed independently.

### Expected results
With respect of business needs, the following outcomes are expected:

  1. Assignment of binary label to each employee (0 - Not At Risk, 1 - At Risk), for the next three month after observed period
  2. Analysis of the historical data and modelling results in order to define the factors that have the most significant impact to the Employees Turnover. Reasoning and conclusions should be represented in view of report.
  3. Sensitivity (what-if) analysis approach description with respect of data insights and modelling results  

### Results Assessment
  * Task 1 will be assessed formally via calculating success score, which reflect the accuracy of the solution with taking into account business criteria.
  * Tasks 2-3 will be assessed for 15 teams who will show high results for the main task and are considered as separate nomination
